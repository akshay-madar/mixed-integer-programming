Here, I try to implement mixed-integer linear programming, based on the 'branch and cut' algorithm. I have used 'ortools' as my choice of library.

```
from ortools.linear_solver import pywraplp
```

## How it helped my Industry Partner (Fortune 200 CPG Company):
Specifically, I have shown how MILP can be used to implement optimization modeling for maximizing profit by creating SKU bundles of fast and slow moving products. 

More details about the above work, and related research can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akshay-madar-4b1871113_fortune200-cpg-profitability-activity-6648322992822677504-thf6).

## Branch and Bound Algo:
Below is a brief summary about MILP and the associated alogorithm from my personal notes.
